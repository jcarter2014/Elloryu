Check Lyft and Uber!


This code is still a work in progress.  I can get Lyft to return price estimates, but I need to add more options than "Standard".
I also need to investigate Uber not being available in an area where I know it should be.

Also, I need to make sure that you can geocode the string in the destination button before performing a segue.
If it isn't an address now, it will crash.
